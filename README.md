# BIG FAT WARNING

This is beta code and information. You assume all responsibility for its use.

**DANGER:** DON'T connect to a PLC unless you are certain it is safe to do so!!! It is assumed that you are experienced in PLC programming/troubleshooting and that you know EXACTLY what you are doing. PLCs are used to control industrial processes, motors, steam valves, hydraulic presses, etc.

**You are ABSOLUTELY RESPONSIBLE for ensuring that NO-ONE is in danger of being injured or killed because you affected the operation of a running PLC.**

Also expect that buggy drivers could write data even when you expect that they will read only!!!
